# Active Scanning

- The attacker interacts directly with 
the target network to find 
vulnerabilities


Example: An attacker sends probes 
and specially crafted requests to the 
target host in the network to identify 
vulnerabilities

# Passive Scanning

- The attacker tries to find vulnerabilities 
without directly interacting with the 
target network

Example: An attacker guesses the 
operating system information, 
applications, and application and 
service versions by observing the TCP 
connection setup and teardown
