## Vulnerability-Management Life Cycle

- The vulnerability management life cycle is an important process that helps identify and 
remediate security weaknesses before they can be exploited. 

- This includes defining the risk 
posture and policies for an organization, creating a complete asset list of systems, scanning, and 
assessing the environment for vulnerabilities and exposures, and taking action to mitigate the 
vulnerabilities that are identified.

- The implementation of a vulnerability management lifecycle 
helps gain a strategic perspective regarding possible cybersecurity threats and renders insecure 
computing environments more resilient to attacks.

- Vulnerability management should be implemented in every organization as it evaluates and 
controls the risks and vulnerabilities in the system. The management process continuously 
examines the IT environments for vulnerabilities and risks associated with the system.

- Organizations should maintain a proper vulnerability management program to ensure overall 
information security.

- Vulnerability management provides the best results when it is 
implemented in a sequence of well-organized phases.
